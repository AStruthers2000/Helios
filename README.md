# Helios: An Overhaul for Factorio

## Overview
**Helios** is a comprehensive overhaul/expansion mod for [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/), designed to extend and expand upon the vanilla gameplay. This overhaul will add in extra items and products to be crafted on each planet, and offer multiple alternative recipes with greater yield/efficiency at the cost of more complex logistics or more resources, effectively a New Game + type of overhaul, similar to [Krastorio](https://github.com/raiguard/Krastorio2). The intended difficulty for the overhaul is somewhere closer to vanilla than Pyanodon's mods.

## Features
 
- **Enhanced Vanilla Gameplay**:
  - Expand your factory’s potential with new technologies, resources, and production challenges.
  - Unlock advanced machines, research breakthroughs, and complex crafting recipes that integrate seamlessly into the base game.

- **New Resources**:
  - Introduce fresh materials sourced from ores, byproducts, and extended processing chains.

- **Extended Processing Chains**:
  - Reimagine vanilla recipes to include more detailed components, adding realism and depth to production.
  - For example, instead of crafting an engine with 1 gear, 1 steel, and 1 pipe, you’ll need components like pistons, engine casings, bolts, and spark plugs. The focus is on creating longer but manageable production paths.
    
- **Alternative Recipes**:
  - Base game recipes remain available, but new, more efficient alternatives are introduced.
  - For instance, craft electronic circuits faster using 1 PCB and 1 insulated wire, but creating the PCB requires 5 plastic bars, 2 crystals (a byproduct of stone mining), and 50 sulfuric acid, while insulated wire is made from rubber (grown on Gleba or processed from oil). These recipes reward advanced production setups with better yields.

- **Improved Planetary and Space Systems**:
  - Each planet receives expanded mechanics tied to its unique resources and environment.
  - Expand the unique mechanics of each planet to deepen the gameplay experience:
    - **Vulcanus**: features additional metallic alloys and advanced smelting technologies to reflect its specialization.
    - **Gleba**: Enhance its agricultural focus by introducing new crops, such as grains, vegetables, mushrooms, and moss. These additions open up diverse production chains and natural resource harvesting opportunities.
    - **Asteroids**: Currently, asteroids primarily offer basic resources like iron and copper. Expand their role by adding trace amounts of precious metals and rare elements, incentivizing exploration and mining.
  - **Asteroid Harvesting and Rare Resources**: Introduce asteroid fields containing rare materials that can only be gathered by specialized "gatherer" space platforms. This encourages players to build dedicated harvesting ships and platforms, going beyond simple transport logistics.
  - **New Goals for Spaceships**: Move beyond planetary travel by incorporating missions requiring resource collection in space, emphasizing the need for advanced ship designs and asteroid mining fleets.

- **Dyson Sphere Endgame**:
  - Take on the ultimate engineering challenge: constructing a Dyson sphere around the sun.
  - Use its immense energy to power the *Helios Project*, unlocking game-changing mechanics and a narrative-driven conclusion to your journey.
